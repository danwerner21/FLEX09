TSC's FLEX9 V2.9:2 for  N8VEM 6x0x board
It is fully functional FLEX9 system, but some (nonessential) features are missing.
Some of the missing features:
- use interrupt driven serial port.
- change dsk images on SD card without power cycle
- y2k patch


Content:
assist09 - Motorola's Assist09 monitor adapted for 6x0x board
           added [F]lex command to automatically boot into Flex9
           Burn Flash with content of ASSISTN8.bin
           
sd       - content of SD card, copy on freshly FAT16 formatted SD card root
            FLEX.SYS is OS executable
            FLEX_0.DSK contains all FLEX9 included commands and a few other tools
            FLEX_1.DSK empty work disk
            FLEX_2.DSk and FLEX_3.DSK are included so the system works, i don't know what they contain

prop_io  - Propeller code, use Parallax IDE, BST or program propIO.eeprom into 24c256
           Code is not fully developed, so it doesn't support mounting new SD without power cycle
           Currently uses 'mb_rawb_spi' object in fsrw for faster SD card access. If it doesn't work,
           recompile with 'safe_spi'. 

flex9    - Flex source code, adapted for N8VEM from Michael Evenson's sources (included in SWTPCemu emulator)

dsk      - A few examples of dsk images from SWTPCemu install

as9      - Motorola's assembler for 6809 (http://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/m6809.html)
as09     - Frank Kingswood's 6809 assembler (http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/assemblers/)

To use any of the dsk images, choose one and rename it to FLEX_x.DSK, copy it into SD directory.
Delete SD card (permanent delete or quick format!)
Copy content of SD directory to SD card.
Propeller expects files on SD card to be in continous sectors!
For Propeller to have enough time to set up, the jumper JP5 must be in 2-3 position, 
and 6809 can not reset the Propeller.
That is the reason for power cycle on SD card change.

To rebuild there is some manual work required, because FLEX drivers reside in ROM.
FLEX9 is in ram between $C000-$DFFF, 
I/O is between $E000-$F000
Drivers could be either in ram below $C000 or in Flash above $F000.

Assemble Assist09:
cd to_assist_dir
../as9 ASSISTN8.ASM -l s19 now

Assemble FLEX9
cd to_flex9_dir
../as09 -inxsl FLEX9.asm

Manualy cut S-records above $F000 from FLEX9.s19 and paste into ASSISTN8.s19
Delete S5 records (recordcount)

srec_cat FLEX9.s19 -offset - -minimum-addr FLEX9.s19 -o FLEX.SYS -binary
srec_cat ASSISTN8.s19 -fill 0xff 0 0xffff -o ASSIST.bin -binary

Copy FLEX.SYS to SD card,
Burn ASSIST.bin into Flash.

enter 
G F1C9
at Assist09 prompt to enter into test loop for 
Propeller PS2 and VGA.

This version uses pin 11 (PD1) of VIA1 to select between serial port and Prop console.
The PD1 pin can be pulled to Vcc for serial port or to GND for Prop VGA & PS2.
Production boards incorporate a jumper J3 for this purpose.
When in serial port mode the board will boot in ASSIST09 monitor. To boot Flex
press <F>.
When in Prop mode the Flex will boot automatically on reset. 
JP5 should connect pins 2-3.
After power cycle the board has to be reset manually to boot Flex properly!

To set the RTC boot into FLEX, press reset or type MON
and in ASSIST09 type
G F48F
then type in date and time in exact format:
>G F48F                                 
                                        
ENTER DATE AND TIME(MM,DD,YY-HH,MI,SS): 07,26,14-09,26,00
THANK YOU
